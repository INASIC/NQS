# Solving the Quantum Many-Body Problem with Artificial Neural Networks

I worked on an undergraduate final year project over a period of 2-3 months that involved reproducing the results found from this [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02318.pdf) by G. Carleo and M. Troyer. I made efforts to expand upon these results to solve for the ground state of a quantum particle in a box using a class of artifical neural networks known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines. 

Obtained results and the method developed can be viewed in this repository in the [Dissertation.pdf](https://github.com/INASIC/NQS/blob/master/Dissertation.pdf) file.
