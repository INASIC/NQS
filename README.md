# Solving the Quantum Many-Body Problem with Artificial Neural Networks

I worked on an undergraduate final year project over a period of 2-3 months that involved reproducing the results found from this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02318. I made efforts to expand upon these results to solve for the ground state of a quantum particle in a box using a class of artifical neural networks known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines. 

Obtained results and the method developed can be viewed in this repository in the __dissertation.pdf__ file.
